 OLS_2 and OLS 3d

 Overview

This project demonstrates Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression in python using synthetic data.  
We predict student final scores based on:
1) Hours studied per week  
2) Attendance percentage  

 (1,2 doesnt mean any priority order, LO)

 Features

    Fit OLS regression model using  'statsmodels' 
    Visualize regression line in 2D  
    Visualize errors  
    Predict new student scores  

 3D visualizations

    Scatter plot with both hours studied and attendance  
    Regression plane showing how both features affect final scores


  Requirements

   Python 3.x  
   numpy, pandas, matplotlib, statsmodels
